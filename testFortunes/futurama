Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase 'upside your head'.
%
And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding-ding-ding-ding.
%
Are all the tests gonna involve drinking?
%
Behold, the internet.
%
Bender knows love, and love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy. Love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy! I love you meatbags!
%
Bender must be stoped! I've gone too far! Who does that guy think I am!?
%
Bite my shiny metal ass.
%
Dumb-Dumb away!
%
Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
%
Finally, we made it out of that godforsaken cave! So what's the fastest way home, back through the cave?
%
Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
%
Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm... so... great!
%
Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
%
Here's your Gutenberg Bible, masters, plus the Colonel's Secret Recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt!
%
Hey that punk stole our hood ornament! Now no one will know we have the LX Package!
%
Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do!
%
Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
%
Humans are dumb and they die easy.
%
Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
%
I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh... also, comes with double prize money.
%
I don't blame myself, I blame all of you!
%
I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
%
I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
%
I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen.
%
I'm Bender, please insert liquor!
%
Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say, unconscious?
%
It's not all about money; although I would like much much more.
%
It's not on the list of approved bendable materials but... I'm... the... greatest!
%
Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
%
Nailed it!
%
No! I want to live! There's still too many things I don't own!
%
No, he's not a zombie. But I don't want people to think I'm incompetent, so I'd better kill you just to be sure.
%
No, that's a hobo and a rabbit, but they're making a hobbit.
%
Of all the friends I've had... you're the first.
%
Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!
%
Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth!
%
Then a damned army we shall have!
%
There's gas in our ass!
%
This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
%
Time to go clubbing, baby seals here I come.
%
Watcha doin', mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in
%
Well if the League of Robots isn't real, how come I had a whole sticker-book of 'em when I was younger? Answer that with your precious logic!
%
Well, we're boned!
%
While I was hacking off the Professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had time to think. Who could use a doomsday device more, the scammers, or me, Bender? After several minutes of steady sawing, I had the answer. Me, Bender!
%
You may have to 'metaphorically' make a deal with the 'devil.' And by 'devil,' I mean Robot Devil. And by 'metaphorically,' I mean get your coat.
%
Your best is an idiot!
%
All right diamond, you won those rounds but I've got an ace up my hole.
%
Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
%
I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
%
It's like a party in my mouth and everybody's throwing up!
%
There's so many killbots behind us, I can't count them all. Three, I think.
%
They're like sex, except I'm having them!
%
We're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere.
%
When will young people learn that playing 'Dungeons and Dragons' doesn't make you cool!
%
Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
%
Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
%
Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
%
Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now includes everything!
%
Bender, this is Fry's decision... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
%
I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
%
I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!
%
That's not a career, more of a felony.
%
That's not a warning! A warning's supposed come before something bad happens.
%
This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
%
This isn't heaven! It just looks exactly like it and makes us immortal! Which I find suspicious.
%
What is the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
%
Bender! Stop killing for a minute!
%
Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
%
Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I suppose I could part with one and still be fearedâ€¦
%
Everybody out of the conference room! I'm calling a conference!
%
Good God! Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo!
%
Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
%
Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be...
%
I am calling a mandatory company meeting. To the mandatorium!
%
I can wire anything directly into anything - I'm the professor!
%
I'm sciencing as fast as I can!
%
I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
%
Less invasions, more equations!
%
Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about.
%
Now I've often said 'Good news' when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is.
%
Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
%
Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
%
Oh, dreadfully real. If you die here you'll really be dead. But instead of science we believe in crazy hocus pocus. It's sort of like Kansas.
%
Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
%
Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
%
Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out.
%
That proves nothing! And furthermore, you'd think I could remember a thing like that; plus, who are you anyway?
%
There's just one little problem, and it's a big one.
%
There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!
%
To better understand the anomaly, I will test its effects on this Giant Medium-Sized Ant.
%
Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
%
Who did this? Answer now or be punished.
%
Yes, it's the apocalypse all right. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
%
Your squad sucks bosons! My team is twice as qualified and three times as expendable!
%
All good things must come to an end; preferably in a humongous explosion.
%
Bender here has identified the femdito commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at.
%
Ever since man first left his cave and met a stranger with a different language and a new way of looking at things, the human race has had a dream: to kill him, so we don't have to learn his language or his new way of looking at things.
%
I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
%
Ladies, you're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded again and again.
%
Me like snu-snu!
%
Same speed ahead!
%
Something is very wrong here. And yet, a bit right.
%
Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
%
The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
%
We fight this battle not for ourselves, but for our children, and our children's children, which is why I'm forming a children's brigade.
%
We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
